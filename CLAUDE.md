# Working on this repo

A text-based narrative political thriller with real electoral mechanics, set in a
federated republic of orbital habitats. No build step, no framework, no bundler.
Open `index.html` in a browser to play, `editor.html` to author.

## HANDOFF — opencode, 11 Sep 2026 (dialogs, Concordance offices, chamber)

opencode worked on `main` at the author's direction and touched files outside its
usual lane. **Read this before editing `js/` or `content/encyclopedia.js`.** The
two features are in `git log` as *"Replace the browser's dialogs with the
terminal's own"* and *"Derive Concordance offices and party leaders from the
cabinet"*, both pushed.

**Native dialogs are gone.** New `js/dialog.js` draws `alert`/`confirm`/`prompt`
in the terminal's own chrome and answers through callbacks, not promises:

```
Dialog.alert(msg, opts?, done?)        done()
Dialog.confirm(msg, opts?, answer?)    answer(true|false)
Dialog.prompt(msg, opts?, answer?)     answer(string|null)
```

Every call site in `js/shell.js`, `js/ui.js` and `js/editor.js` now uses it; the
host is `#dlgdlg` and the CSS is `.dlg-*` in `terminal.css`. **The test harnesses
answer it through the same callbacks** (`tools/harness.js`, `tools/edtest.js`
override `Dialog.confirm/prompt/alert`), so if you change the signature you must
change those too or `npm run ui`/`ux`/`editor` stop booting. A dev-only check for
the module itself was left in `%TEMP%\opencode\dlgtest.js`, not in the repo.

**The Concordance derives offices now.** `js/encyclopedia.js` reads who holds
what from `C.cabinet` and `C.parties[].leader` (`officesOf`/`mainOffice`/
`officeLine`) instead of trusting a typed `role`. Person articles gained a
wikibox (Party / Seat / **Offices held**); the lede follows the office. Party
articles gained Leader + Leader's office + a Leadership section. Infobox rows
support a section header as `["", "Offices held", "head"]`. `js/refs.js`
`characterRefs` now follows `cabinet[].holder` and `parties[].leader`, so a
rename reaches both.

**New content fields to know about:** `parties[].leader` (a character id; `null`
for `ind`) and `cabinet[].title` (the *minister's* title, e.g. "Treasurer" or
"Leader of the House", distinct from the ministry `name`). The editor does not
expose either yet but serialises them unchanged.

**Content corrections made in the same pass:** Marin is Minister for Persons and
Continuity again (Abadi keeps `fc_medicine`, backbench); Anselm Ring's
composition was rebalanced so the population-weighted composition is the bible's
64/28/4/4; and stale facts in `content/encyclopedia.js` were fixed (station
count, functional-electorate range, the full cabinet ministry list, "two
Congregational Democratic Alliance Ministers", a doubled "the").

**Two inconsistencies left open, both content, both flagged here:**

- `content/labour.js` `embodied` values weight to **~68%** of jobs; bible §6.10
  says **46%**. The encyclopedia article follows the bible, so the labour table
  is the outlier.
- Station populations sum to **7,006,000**; `labour.js totals.population` is
  **6,863,000**. 143,000 apart.

**Also landed since that handoff:** row selection is now the gold tint in every
table (`.sel` was the dark inverted block; the `#cons-table` override is gone and
`tools/uxtest.js` was updated to match); a member-table tooltip widens to 360px
(`#tipcard.wide`) so a full office title fits on one line; and three Liberal
functional-seat MPs now hold shadow briefs — Quintana/Substrate, Ijaz/Transit,
Estévez/Anchors — with Otrione, Caillet and Nadeau backbenched. `js/ui.js` gained
`officeText()` for the full office in the functional tooltip.

**More since:** Gecko gets a drawn scrollbar (`decorateScrollers()` in `js/ui.js`
wraps `.p-cons`/`.p-doss` bodies in `.sbwrap` and appends `.sbar`; WebKit/Blink
keep their native bar — the check is `CSS.supports("selector(::-webkit-scrollbar)")`);
the whip's `MOVE` column is a segmented `.whipbar` (one block per whippable seat),
not a range input; and the orbit tab dropped the `p-cond` panel — the constituency
dossier is now an expandable `.consdet` row inside `#cons-table` (`consOpen` state,
`constituencyDetail()`), with `p-doss` spanning the full right column. Next up,
per the author: constituency prose (description, voting tendencies) in the expanded
row, then a capital designation.

**The capital is in:** `content/stations.js` has `winter_garden` (The Winter
Garden, ring band, 80k, one seat) and `content/constituencies.js` has
`capital_territory` (Capital Territory, `at_large`, `nonVoting: true`). The engine
reads `nonVoting`: `seedRoll`/`reconcile` carry the flag into the roll, and
`syncRoll`, `partyDistrict`, `vacantSeats`, `tierCheck`, `apportionment` and
`generalElection` all skip it, so the seat has a member and a page but sits outside
the 140-seat tier, the 280 chamber and every division. `test.js` was updated
(141 constituencies, 140 voting; station seats 141) and the `commonwealth` article's
station count moved to thirty. One fiction wrinkle left: the capital's electorate
(49,200) is excluded from the district-roll sum in `test.js`, so its adults are not
inside the bible's 4,149,803 and the districts were not rebalanced.

**Do not commit** the untracked root duplicates (`events.js`, `glossary.js`,
`lint.js`, `encyclopedia_content.js`, `encyclopedia_renderer.js`, `js/codex.js`)
or the `tools/dither.sh` mode change — they are pre-existing and left alone.

## OPEN HANDOFF — a divergent branch must be reconciled (10 Sep 2026)

A second agent (opencode) worked from a **stale clone** and committed a line of
work that is **not on this branch**. It is pushed and waiting:

`git fetch origin opencode/party-rename-and-economy`

Built on the old base `49344d6` (before the UI pass and `STATE_VERSION 6`), it
contains:

- **Five signed axes** (`economic · authority · personhood · sovereignty · trade`)
  replacing the four categorical ones, with agreement as distance.
- **§7.10 the productive economy**: `economy.participation/trade/private`, the
  `economy` effect verb, `economyAbove/Below`, state v5.
- **Renamed parties**, and the old `gb` split in two.
- `ROADMAP.md`, `AUTHORING_FORMAT.md`, `drafts/`, and bible **Part XVII**.

The branch is **ahead 1, behind 38**. Its engine half (axes, economy, migration)
was written against v5 and conflicts with the current v6 engine — **Claude owns
that rebase.**

**The party rename IS landed on `main`.** It was landed once (`1b6c3b5`), reverted
(`55aa28a`) because adding the 12th party `ind` **crashed the chamber, orbit and
Concordance on existing saves**, and re-landed with the hole closed:
`Engine.reconcile()` now backfills parties and currents from content, exactly as
it already did for stations, and `test.js` asserts it. The six district seats
moved to `ind` in `content/constituencies.js`, and `ind:"against"` holds the
divergence forecast at 128.

When rebasing the branch, **keep only the engine work** (five axes, §7.10
economy, migration, roadmap/docs) and **drop the rename and the split** — they
are already here. The table is a record:

| id | name | short |
|---|---|---|
| cu | Party of Socialists and Democrats | PSD |
| cl | Liberal Party | LIB |
| psa | New Progressive Party | NPP |
| sc | Home Rule | HR |
| hul | Association of Engineers and Systems | AES |
| rv | Congregational Democratic Alliance | CDA |
| fh | Freehold Party | FH |
| gb | Alliance of Business and Government | ABG |
| des | One-G | ONE |
| geo | Single Tax Party | STP |
| upl | Uplift Alliance | UPA |
| ind | Independents | IND |

Three of those were renamed again on 14 Sep 2026 under bible §8.3's rule that a
party names itself for who it is and not for what it opposes: `fh` was the
*Party of Property Owners*, which is what a tax form calls them; `rv` was the
*Democratic Centre*, which described neither their economics nor their faith;
`upl` was *Common Kind*, a good phrase that identified nobody. **The ids never
changed and are still the initials of the pre-rename names** — `cu` for Commons
Union, `psa` for Public Substrate Association, and so on — so an id is a poor
guide to what a party is now called. Read `content/parties.js`.

## Finding things without reading everything

`bible.md` is ~1,700 lines and `textbook.md` ~750. Reading either in full to
answer one question is the most expensive habit available here.

- `bible.md` carries a generated section index at the top, with a line number
  per section. Read the index, then the range: `sed -n '274,296p' bible.md`.
  `npm run toc` rebuilds it; `npm run tocheck` (part of `npm run check`) fails
  if it has gone stale. Never hand-edit the index block.
- `node tools/toc.js --index textbook.md` prints the same thing for the
  textbook without touching the file. Its `## CONTENTS` is in-world prose
  written by Charnock and takes no line numbers.
- Section status is in the index: **LOCKED** is settled canon, **OPEN** is
  genuinely undecided, **LEANING** is a working answer that may move.

Where the answer lives, when it is not obvious:

| Question | Look in |
|---|---|
| what a rule *is* | `bible.md`, via the index |
| what a number *is* | `bible.md` §11 named canon, or the content file itself |
| how it *reads* in-world | `textbook.md` |
| which seats exist, who holds them | `content/constituencies.js` — the roll |
| what a station is | `content/stations.js` |
| what an effect verb does | `js/schema.js`, then `EFFECTS` in `js/engine.js` |
| what is being built now | `sweep-brief.md` |

## Before changing anything

Read the relevant sections of `bible.md`. It is canon and it is long. In
particular:

- **§2.7 generation drift** — the station roster, the person roster and the
  glossary are frozen lists. Do not invent a station, a character or a setting
  term. Add to canon deliberately, in the content files, not in passing.
- **§1.5 engine constraints** — six or seven orthogonal scalars, deterministic
  resolution. **Do not add randomness to event selection.** Determinism is what
  makes balance testable.
- **§2.6 explanation cost** — one concept cluster per event. `tools/lint.js`
  enforces it.

`textbook.md` is in-world and knows nothing about the game. Where it disagrees
with the bible on a number, the bible wins. Where it disagrees on tone, it wins.

## The one architectural rule

**`js/engine.js` names no event, no party, no station.** Content is data in
`content/*.js`, conforming to schemas the engine defines. If you find yourself
editing the engine to add content, stop — the thing you want is a new entry in a
content file, or rarely a new verb in `EFFECTS`/`CONDITIONS` plus a matching
entry in `js/schema.js` so the editor can author it.

Content is `.js` rather than `.json` on purpose: `fetch()` is blocked on
`file://`, `<script src>` is not, so the game opens from disk with no server.

## Run the checks

```
npm install      # once, for jsdom
npm run check    # all nine, about three seconds
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `test.js` | chamber arithmetic against the bible, tier reconciliation, instrument acceptance, 40-sitting smoke test |
| `tools/lint.js` | legibility: concept load per event, terms used before taught |
| `tools/cxcheck.js` | Concordance links, see-alsos, banners |
| `tools/roundtrip.js` | editor fidelity: serialise → reload → identical play |
| `tools/renametest.js` | renaming an id preserves behaviour exactly |
| `tools/edtest.js` | editor boots and every tab works |
| `tools/uitest.js` | menu into a running game, every screen renders, saves round-trip |
| `tools/uxtest.js` | focus, tips, audio, streaming, the division dialog |
| `tools/toc.js --check` | the bible's section index is current |

**Run them after any content change.** They are the only playtester this project
has until a human one arrives.

## Things that have already gone wrong

One line each, kept because they will otherwise happen again. The long
version of any of them is in the header of the file it names.

**Content and state**

- `payWhips` clears the plan, so a caller that divided afterwards charged for
  nothing. Always use `Engine.divide()`.
- `apportionment_ratio` was stored beside seats and population and the three
  diverged. Derived, never stored.
- The district tier summed to 56 while parties held 140. `test.js` reconciles
  both directions.
- Bump `STATE_VERSION` when the state shape changes, and write the migration
  guard ASCENDING, one block per bump — a descending guard let a v1 save match
  `< 4`, get stamped 4, and skip every earlier block.
- Content owns identity (name, band, form, seats); the save owns simulation
  (closure, suspended, attested). `Engine.reconcile()` runs on every load
  because a new station used to leave older saves with a hole in `st.stations`.
- Player preferences go in `Shell.opts`; world state goes in the save. Mute in
  a save file silences somebody else's machine on import.
- `CONTENT.encyclopedia` is an object — `meta`, `banners`, `articles` — not a
  list.

**CSS and layout traps, every one found by measuring rather than reading**

- An id outranks `.screen{display:none}`, so `#s-orb.screen{display:block}` put
  the habitat map on every tab at once. Any rule whose subject is a `#s-…`
  screen must include `.on`.
- Setting `scrollbar-color` or `scrollbar-width` makes Chromium silently ignore
  every `::-webkit-scrollbar` rule for that element. The standard properties are
  fenced behind `@supports not selector(::-webkit-scrollbar)`.
- `overflow-x:auto` forces `overflow-y:auto` too. Anything that scrolls in one
  axis says so in both.
- An inline `<svg>` with a viewBox and no width fills its container, so
  shrinking the coordinate space only magnifies the drawing.
- A class named for an appearance gets borrowed for anything wanting that
  appearance: `.sel` came to mean four things at once. It now means selection
  only; `.warn`, `.inforce`, `.vacant` and the editor's `.here` say what they
  mean, and differ in form as well as hue.
- The same trap from the other side: reusing an EXISTING component's class
  name for a new component. The main menu's ticker was nested in `.ticker`,
  whose `.ticker div` rule sets `padding-left:100%`, so every headline was
  pushed exactly one screen right and off the edge — rendering correctly,
  present in the DOM, invisible. Found by measuring: a span at x=1195 in a
  container ending at x=1195. Check whether a class exists before taking it.

**Interface**

- Renderers replace containers wholesale, so focus falls to `document.body` on
  every state change. `js/focus.js` restores it by DATA KEY, never by index, and
  owns the only selection store — selection used to live in four places and the
  order paper hardcoded its highlight as a result.
- `.focus()` scrolls its target into view and will undo a scroll restore
  standing next to it. Restore with `{preventScroll:true}`, scroll after, and
  `scrollIntoView` only on a move the player asked for.
- Two listeners for one action is not twice as safe: `[data-go]` was bound in
  both `js/ui.js` and `js/encyclopedia.js` and every click rendered twice,
  invisibly. A keyboard path reaches the existing handler (`el.click()`).
- Sound comes from engine effects and user actions ONLY — never from `drawAll()`
  or anything reachable from it. Streaming text obeys this too: the renderer
  puts the finished text up silently and the ACTION HANDLERS reveal it.
- A division resolves on the click, before its dialog opens. That is what makes
  skipping safe and "muted reaches the same state" testable.
- Blanking text to type it out collapses the block; measure and hold the height.
- `js/tips.js` explains the TERMINAL; the Concordance and glossary explain the
  WORLD, and a tip with no body falls through to them, so nothing restates canon
  (§2.7). `?` is the keyboard trade: annotated readouts enter the tab order on
  the visible screen only. The Concordance screen itself carries no annotations
  on purpose — it is not government chrome, and it is where tips send you.
  `tools/uxtest.js` asserts an explanation nobody anchors is a failure, because
  it reads as coverage and is not.
- There is NO ASSET LOADING and cannot easily be: on `file://`, `fetch()` and
  `XMLHttpRequest` both fail. Base64 in a `.js` file through `atob` into
  `decodeAudioData` is the route that works.

Every one of these is asserted somewhere in `npm run check`. Two of the checks
exist because of a specific miss: `tools/edtest.js` because a form function was
referenced in the editor and never defined, and `tools/uitest.js` because a
blank screen is invisible to every static check.

## Authoring

See `CONTENT_GUIDE.md`. The short version: copy an existing entry in
`content/events.js` and change it. Effects and conditions are a closed
vocabulary — if it grows past about twenty verbs, content is leaking into the
engine.
