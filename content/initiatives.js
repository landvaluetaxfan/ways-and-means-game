/* INITIATIVES — what the government puts in motion, rather than answers.

   Every one of these is a COMMITMENT WITH A CLOCK THE PLAYER WINDS. She
   spends order-paper time, she chooses how it is done, and the answer
   arrives later as an event she did not schedule and cannot recall.

   TEMPO IS THE DECISION. A word in the corridor comes back next sitting
   and is worth what a corridor is worth; a formal approach takes a week
   and carries the government's weight behind it. Neither is correct, and
   an initiative whose tempos differ only in speed is a difficulty
   setting rather than a choice — give them different effects.

   Fields:
     cost    order-paper slots, before the tempo's own surcharge
     when    the same condition vocabulary events use
     event   the answer, queued `after` sittings by the chosen tempo
     tempo   [{ label, after, cost?, effects?, when? }] -- a tempo's own
             `when` closes that way of doing it without closing the others

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   The three below are the opening set: one relationship, one piece of
   information, one public commitment. Each queues an answer event in
   content/events.js, and the tempo decides which branch of it is open
   to her. `npm run lint` fails if an `event` here has no event there.
