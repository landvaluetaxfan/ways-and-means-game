/* =============================================================
   LABOUR

   What people actually do, and what proportion of them do it.

   THE ANCHORS ARE ALREADY CANON. Population 7,086,000, which is the
   station roster in content/stations.js and is compared against it by
   tools/lint.js so the two cannot drift again. Adult roll 4,149,803.
   Of those, 239,803 hold a functional franchise and 3,910,000 sit in
   the residual constituency. Every figure below is derived from those
   and must stay consistent with them; the licensed counts in
   functional.js are the hard constraint.

   THREE FACTS THE TABLE IS BUILT TO CARRY:

   1. Most adults do not work. Automation took bulk production two
      centuries ago. Participation is 38 per cent, and the consumables
      floor and substrate insurance are not a safety net — they are the
      primary distribution mechanism. What people argue about is the
      uprating formula, never whether the floor exists. (Bible 2.1:
      the radical thing is settled and old.)

   2. Licensure is a narrow gate on a wide sector. 142,000 people do
      verification work; 890 of them are licensed, and those 890 elect
      two MPs. 63,000 work in life support; 4,100 are licensed. The
      gap between "does the work" and "votes in the seat that
      represents the work" is the whole of 4.6.4.

   3. Fork labour does not appear in the table, because instances are
      not legally persons and are therefore not employed. They perform
      roughly a fifth of all recorded labour-hours. Lowering the
      divergence threshold does not create those hours; it makes them
      employment.

   share      per cent of the employed workforce
   embodied   share of that category's work requiring a physical body
   licensed   holders of the relevant licence, where one exists
   forkable   how exposed the category is to instance labour

   THE EMBODIED LINE IS 46 PER CENT (bible 6.10, LOCKED): "46% of jobs
   require a body and biologicals hold nearly all of them." The
   per-category figures are scaled so that the share-weighted average is
   46, with gravity work held at 1.00 because the anchor terminals
   literally cannot be staffed any other way.
