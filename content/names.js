/* =============================================================
   NAMELISTS

   Pools for rolling names when you need one and do not care which.

   Naming in this setting is not neutral. Orbital industry recruited
   from everywhere at once and recruited fast, so the founding
   populations arrived already mixed rather than blending over
   generations — two decades is nowhere near long enough to blend a
   population, and it did not have to. Given names and family names
   cross freely and a person's name says little about their origin,
   which is itself the point. What *does* carry
   information:

     - Earth-born arrivals more often keep an unblended family name,
       and everyone notices. See bible 10.2, nativism inverted.
     - Emulations who forked before the schedule of persons was
       settled sometimes carry a numeric suffix in the registry that
       they do not use socially.
     - Station names divide sharply by era: the founding generation
       named habitats for people and instruments, the industrial
       expansion named them for what they did.

   Add a list by adding a key. `Names.roll("given")` returns one;
   `Names.person()` assembles a full name.
