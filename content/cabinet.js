/* =============================================================
   CABINET — the Ministries, as data.

   Bible 3.9 lists them; this makes them a thing the game can hold.
   Two mechanics depend on it:

   1. The President's appointment-refusal power (3.3, power 4) had
      nothing to refuse until now.
   2. Every statutory instrument names an author. A vacant post cannot
      make one — which is the interlock that turns the appointment
      fight and the licensing-board fight into the same fight.

   Life Support is the senior post and the one that ends careers. It is
   the only Ministry whose Minister may be summoned BY the engineering
   authority rather than the reverse, under the Allocation Act.

   The Treasury sits apart and reports directly to the Prime Minister.
