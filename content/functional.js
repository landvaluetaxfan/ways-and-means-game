/* =============================================================
   FUNCTIONAL CONSTITUENCIES — 40 seats.

   Electorates are professions and industries rather than places.
   Bible 4.6: the founding compromise. The Charter's drafters needed
   the engineering guilds and the consortiums to accept civilian rule
   and paid with permanent seats. Explicitly transitional; the sunset
   clause has been extended four times.

   franchise decides how the seat is actually won, and each type plays
   completely differently:
     licensure   individuals holding a professional licence. The
                 government appoints the licensing board, so it can
                 widen or narrow the electorate by regulation, without
                 legislation. Bible 4.6.4 — the sharpest tool available.
     corporate   companies vote, not employees. Whoever controls the
                 company controls the seat. Electorates in the dozens.
     union_bloc  a union casts a bloc vote for its members.
     residual    everyone in no recognised sector: the unemployed, the
                 dependent, the suspended. Enormous, powerless,
                 grotesque. Bible 4.6.5 — the super-seat.

   held is the OPENING. At runtime the authority is the state's functional
   roll (st.functional), seeded from this and moved only by the `functional`
   effect, and each party's functional count is DERIVED from it. This held
   must still sum, across all sectors, to the party counts in parties.js;
   test.js checks both directions.

   electors — WHO IS ACTUALLY ON THE ROLL. Individual licence-holders,
   recognised unions casting for their membership, or registered
   companies, depending on franchise. The counts sum to `electorate`
   and test.js asserts it.

   gatekeeper — who decides admission to the roll. Most are appointed
   by the government, which is bible 4.6.4: the electorate can be
   widened or narrowed by regulation, without legislation, and that is
   the sharpest tool in the game. `appointed_by:"registry"` means the
   government cannot reach it directly, which is what makes those
   constituencies expensive to move.

   Seats here are contested by a MIXTURE: national partisan parties
   standing candidates, and professional bodies acting as political
   organisations in their own right. See parties.js `kind`.
