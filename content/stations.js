/* =============================================================
   STATIONS — the frozen roster. 35 habitats across five bands.

   A station is a PLACE: a mark on the orbital chart with a form, a
   population and a closure ratio. A CONSTITUENCY is a thing that
   returns members, and lives in constituencies.js. Most stations
   return one; the largest are divided.

   THE ORBITAL CHART reads three fields per station and encodes each
   as a separate visual variable, so one mark carries three facts:
     band       vertical position   — altitude, and therefore class
     form       glyph shape         — what kind of habitat it is
     population glyph size          — log-scaled
   Closure tints the fill and the leading party marks a tick beneath.

   seats: total district seats, equal to the sum of this station's
   constituencies' magnitudes. tools/test.js checks this both ways.

   apportionment_ratio is NOT here. It is derived per constituency by
   Engine.apportionment() from magnitude and electorate, because
   storing it beside seats and population let the three drift apart —
   Homestead was once recorded at 1.88 while its actual seats-per-head
   matched Anselm's 0.88.

   composition: share of adults by legal category. Commonwealth-wide
   the split is biological 0.64, emulation 0.28, uplift 0.04,
   synthetic 0.04.

   THE TWO SCARCITIES RUN IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS ACROSS THE ROSTER,
   and that is what sets composition:

     Volume is positional. Anselm Ring volume is astronomical because
     everybody wants to be there; Homestead volume is nearly free
     because nobody does.

     Thermal rejection is geometric. A habitat in low orbit sheds heat
     while sitting in Earth's infrared glare; far-band and Lagrange
     habitats have far better geometry, so substrate is cheap there.

   So the low band is embodied (cheap volume, dear substrate) and the
   far band and Lagrange are emulation-heavy. People are priced out of
   their bodies on GOOD stations, not poor ones.

   form: cylinder | torus | drum | sphere | cluster | yard | surface
