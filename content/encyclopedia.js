   THE CONCORDANCE — in-world encyclopedia.

   ARCHITECTURE: this is a VIEW over content that already exists.
   Parties, stations, characters, bills and glossary terms all get
   articles generated from their own data — seat counts, closure
   ratios and division forecasts come live from state, so the
   encyclopedia is never out of date and never contradicts canon.

   You only write an entry here when you want prose the data cannot
   produce: history, controversy, the argument about the thing.

   REGISTER: Wikipedia. A lead that defines the subject in its first
   sentence, sentence-case headings, neutral third person, no address
   to the reader. The bias lives in the BANNERS and the edit record,
   never in the sentences. Bible 9.4: ideologies are refracted, not
   presented; the maintenance banner is the refraction. See
   CONTENT_GUIDE.md, "The register".
