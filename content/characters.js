/* CHARACTERS — the fixed roster. Additions are deliberate canon: a content
   pass may not invent a person, but the front benches are cast here in full
   so the seat table can mark who is not a backbencher.

   office — the one-word badge the orbit seat table shows beside a member.
   It is a mark, not a job title; `role` carries the full title.
     pm          Prime Minister
     minister    Cabinet minister
     opposition  Leader of the Opposition
     shadow      Shadow minister
     leader      leader of a party
     whip        Chief Whip
   The Speaker is NOT an office here: it is a property of the seat
   (`speaker:true`), because the Chair belongs to the House, not the person.
   Rename people freely — they are referenced by id, and tools/renametest.js
   checks that a rename preserves behaviour.

   The author's cast is all members of the House of Delegates, of one tier or
   another, except the President and the two non-parliamentary voices (the
   press and the deck civilian). A name on the author's list is never below an
   MP.

   NAMING SCHEME — locked.
      Parliament          the legislature
     House of Delegates  the elected chamber
     MP                  Member of Parliament, of any tier
     Prime Minister      head of government, chairs Cabinet
     Ministry            an executive department
     Minister for X      heads a Ministry and sits in Cabinet
   Not: Secretary of State, Department, Secretary-General. The Charter still
   calls the office Secretary-General; nobody has used it in eighty years.
   seat — the constituency a member sits for. It must be a real one:
   two of these previously named constituencies that did not exist
   ("Anselm Ring N & Central", "Homestead A-D"), each straddling two,
   and nothing caught it because nothing linked a person to a seat.

   portrait: filename in img/portraits/ processed with the `registry` palette.
   Omit it and the UI simply renders no portrait.

   SUBSTRATE — bible §6.10's clean structure, not the law's broken one:
     category  what the member is made of: biological | emulation | uplift |
               synthetic. Augmented, interfacing and cyborg are NOT
               categories — they are a biological with statuses, or nothing
               at all and a line in `note`, which is where the President's
               cat ears were already correct.
     status    the relation the member stands in: instance | suspended |
               unattested | disembodied. Usually none.

   THE HOUSE IS NOT PROPORTIONAL AND THAT IS THE POINT. The population is
   64/28/4/4 across 7,086,000. This roster is 54 named members — 42
   biological (77.8%), 9 emulation (16.7%), 2 uplift (3.7%), 1 synthetic
   (1.9%). Emulation is under-represented, and of the twelve who are not
   biological only FOUR hold a district seat (Herrera, Vasmer, Trottier,
   Ivarsen); the rest are functional or list. Districts return the embodied,
   the list tier is where the emulated get in — bible §4.8's sentence about
   the Public Substrate Association, made checkable. */
