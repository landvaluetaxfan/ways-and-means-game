The law says a copy of a person stops being that person after a hundred and

same legal person, reabsorbable, with no separate wage and no separate vote.
Over it, the copy is a stranger with rights.

The bill cuts the line to forty. A working week. Nearly two million copies
become citizens overnight, six districts have to be redrawn, and every employer
who has been spinning staff copies for a week at a time is suddenly employing
people rather than using them.

The New Progressive Party made it the price of joining your government.
Your own maintenance members, who have spent thirty years watching copies
undercut their wages, would rather you had paid a different price.`,
