/* =============================================================
   THE HEADLESS HARNESS — one jsdom, shared by the two DOM checks.

   tools/uitest.js  does the game render, save and screen checks.
   tools/uxtest.js  does focus, tips, audio, streaming and the division.

   They were one file of 780 lines, which is past the size where adding an
   assertion means reading the whole thing to find out where it goes. The
   split is by question rather than by feature: uitest asks "did it draw
   and does it survive a save", uxtest asks "can a person use it".

   Each runs in its own process with its own window, so neither can leave
   state behind that the other depends on - which was already true by
   accident and is now true by construction.

   Needs jsdom:  npm install jsdom
   Skips cleanly if it is not installed.

/* Shell and game smoke test. Loads index.html in a headless DOM, walks the
   main menu into a running game, and checks the things that have broken.

   This exists because two faults shipped that no other check could see:
   a glossary term matched inside markup annotate() had already inserted and
   dumped raw attributes into the prose, and the save/load path was only ever
   exercised by hand. Static parsing finds neither.
