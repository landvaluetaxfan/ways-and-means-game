     WHO ACTUALLY WALKS THROUGH THE LOBBY

     A party's POSITION is one thing and its TURNOUT is another, and
     the gap between them is the whip's whole job. Two things open it.

     Loyalty: full loyalty delivers every member, none still delivers
     three quarters, because a party is not a coalition of strangers.

     Currents: a party with factions is not one bloc voting at one
     rate. Each current turns out at ITS OWN discipline, and a current
     whose axes disagree with the measure does not turn out for it
     however loyal it is — a faction is defined by its position, which
     is what makes it a faction rather than a mood.

     THE CASE THIS EXISTS FOR is a party with no position on an axis
     whose currents all have one. Agreement is scored against the
     CURRENT's axes, not the party's, so a measure the party is neutral
     on can still cost it a third of its benches. That is the whole
     content of "weighted towards several ideological positions", and
     nothing else in the engine could see it.

     Disagreement only ever costs. A current cannot deliver more
     members than it has, so agreement above the party line buys
     nothing — the upside of a popular measure is that the ones who
     disagree stay home rather than vote against.

     MEMBERS ARE A PROPORTION, NOT A COUNT. Content states a current's
     size; the roll states the party's. An election moves the roll and
     will not move the content, so a current is read as its SHARE of
     its party and resized against whatever the party currently holds.
     Storing faction seats beside party seats is the mistake
     apportionment_ratio already taught us once.

     current. This is a SUM, not a model: each current votes its members in
     proportion to its loyalty, the members in no current vote on the party's
     own loyalty, and the revenants — returned on the list, owing their seat to
     the party — are loyal until they break, and then break together.

     Held when the signatures against the PM reach the threshold. A ballot the
     PM loses routes through the existing loss condition, not a second one.

     3b. IMPERFECT INFORMATION (design/08 §7)

     A division is exact — the arithmetic is the argument of the game. What
     the player is SHOWN is not. Every forecast comes from a source, and every
     source is wrong by something: the whips count their own side, a partner is
     honest until its loyalty thins, the functional bench is an estimate, and
     the opposition is a guess.

     The error is DERIVED from the seed and the state, never rolled fresh, so a
     redraw does not move the number and the player cannot re-read it until it
     settles. The point is not the error; it is that a partner whose loyalty is
     collapsing gives you a worse number and does not tell you it is worse.

       reached into and what the bounds were:

         {move:{ treasury:-5 }}              a bare key is a scalar
         {move:{ "loyalty.psa":8 }}          a party OR a current

       Bounds are kept per namespace, not flattened: scalars and loyalty
       clamp 0-100, prices clamp 20-400, and capital is unbounded and
       signed because 7.6 says nothing decays and nothing is forgiven.

       ONE PAIR PER OBJECT is the house style, and it is not cosmetic:
       the editor renders one key-value row per effect, so a multi-key
       object used to lose every key after the first when a human opened
       and saved it. 25 of 53 keyed effects in content were in that
       state. Multi-key objects still WORK here — the loop below takes

     misbuilt: the whole point is that a promise is discharged by
     keeping it, in the place where keeping it happens.

     settle() is therefore called from everything that could keep one -

     PROROGATION — the House rises

     THE ONE THING THAT MAKES THE ORDER PAPER A SCHEDULE. Until this
     existed, order-paper time was a lifetime allowance, nothing was ever
     due, and a bill could sit at committee forever at no cost. 7.7 calls
     time "the currency that cannot be topped up"; this is the period it
     cannot be topped up within.

     BILLS DIE AND INSTRUMENTS SURVIVE. That asymmetry is already the
     argument the Papers screen makes — a bill needs a majority and
     cannot be undone, an order needs no majority and can be revoked —
     and prorogation sharpens it into a reason to reach for the fast,
     deniable tool.

     IT IS NOT A TURN LIMIT. Nothing is lost that cannot be brought back
     next session, poorer. The boundary is a cost, not a fail state.

     the same answer for a deadline three months out as for today.
