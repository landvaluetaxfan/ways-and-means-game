   TIPS — what the abbreviations mean.

   THE PROBLEM: every screen in this game is dense with tokens that
   carry a real rule and explain nothing. LOY. DUAL. A ledger reading
   +2. "committee". "prayable 4". 128 / 240 · need 121. A player who
   does not already know the system is reading a spreadsheet in a
   language nobody taught them, and the glossary does not help because
   it annotates WORDS IN THE FICTION and these are not that.

   THE DIVISION OF LABOUR, which is the only interesting decision here:

     the Concordance and the glossary explain THE WORLD. They are
     content, they are in-world, and they are written by whoever writes
     the fiction. This file explains THE TERMINAL - what a column is,
     what a number does, which rule reads it - and that text has to
     match the engine exactly, so it lives beside the code that must
     stay in step with it and not in content/.

     Where the world already has the answer, this file DEFERS: an entry
     with no body of its own falls through to the glossary, and then to
     the Concordance article of the same id. Nothing here restates
     canon, and nothing here invents any (bible 2.7 - the glossary is a
     frozen list and this file adds nothing to it).

   THE CONCORDANCE IS NOT ANNOTATED, AND THAT IS THE POINT. It is
   deliberately not government chrome - serif, white paper, generous
   leading, something civilians made - and putting terminal tooltips
   inside it would collapse a separation the whole screen is built on.
   It is also the place tips send you, so annotating it would be the
   terminal explaining the thing it just referred you to. tools/uxtest.js
   asserts that every OTHER screen carries annotations and that this one
   carries none.

   NEVER A NATIVE title="". A native tooltip is slow, unstyled,
   invisible to a keyboard, and cannot say two things at once.

   NO SOUND. Tips are triggered by a pointer moving, which is not a
   decision, and a terminal that chirps whenever the mouse crosses a
   table header is a terminal you turn off.
