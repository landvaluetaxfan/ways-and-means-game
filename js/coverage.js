   Answers "what should I do next" from the content itself rather
   than from a fixed checklist.

   The failure mode it exists to catch: a game that only has events
   for crises, so competence is punished with silence. If every event
   fires when thermal margin is low and none fires when it is high,
   the player who manages well gets nothing to do.

   Findings are ordered by how much they hurt. Each one names a
   concrete next action, not a metric.
