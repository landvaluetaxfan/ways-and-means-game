   ORBITAL CHART

   A chart, not a map. Orbits are dynamic and 3D; literal geography
   would be unreadable. Altitude on the vertical axis makes the
   diagram a stratification chart — higher orbit is different
   politics — so the map doubles as an infographic about class.

   WHY THIS IS A GRID AND NOT A SCATTER

   It used to be a scatter: marks placed in a lane, nudged sideways
   to stop them colliding, sorted largest-first so the big ones
   anchored the lane. That layout spent the chart's entire width on
   decoration. Horizontal position carried NO information, and the
   cost was paid in the only currency that mattered — with
   thirty-four stations across five lanes, the labels were too small
   to read, and adding a station made it worse.

   So the width now carries something. Within each band stations run
   left to right by CLOSURE: dependent on the left, self-sufficient
   on the right. That is the real political axis of the setting, it
   needs no collision avoidance, every name stays legible at any
   roster size, and a new station just extends its row.

   FOUR VARIABLES PER CHIP:
     row            band       altitude, and therefore class
     position in row closure   dependent (left) to self-sufficient (right)
     fill tint      closure    the same fact, readable without counting
     bar beneath    party      who leads it

   Form (torus, drum, yard) is deliberately NOT encoded here. It is
   flavour rather than politics, seven values will not survive being
   drawn at chip size, and it is one click away in the dossier. The
   glyph collapses the seven forms to four silhouettes that stay
   distinct at 13px.
