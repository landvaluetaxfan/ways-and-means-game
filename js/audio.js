/* =============================================================
   AUDIO — the bus.

   THE HARD RULE, AND THE REASON THIS FILE HAS A HEADER AT ALL:

     Sound is triggered by ENGINE EFFECTS and USER ACTIONS only.
     No play() call may originate from drawAll(), or from any
     draw* function, directly or transitively.

   A redraw happens for reasons that have nothing to do with the
   player: switching tabs, loading a slot, a mirrored panel
   repainting itself through a MutationObserver, a test harness
   re-entering UI.boot(). A cue fired from a draw function is a
   cue that fires at random, four times in a row, or while the
   main menu is open. Cues therefore live at the point where the
   player did something or where the Engine decided something,
   and nowhere else. tools/uitest.js reads this file and js/ui.js
   and fails the build if that stops being true.

   NO ASSETS. There is no build step and no audio pipeline, so
   every cue here is synthesised from oscillators and one noise
   buffer. That is a constraint rather than a preference, but it
   suits the setting: this is a terminal in a government office,
   not a film.

   NOTHING HERE MAY THROW. Web Audio is absent in jsdom, blocked
   in some embedded browsers, and refuses to start before a user
   gesture everywhere. Every entry point checks and returns.

   PREFERENCES LIVE IN Shell.opts, NOT IN THE SAVE. Mute and the
   per-category gains describe the PLAYER; the save describes the
   WORLD. A save that carried a mute flag would silence a
   different machine on import.

       being celebrated. 12.3 governs here as everywhere: if it reads as
       triumphant it is wrong. There is a paper thud under it because
       this is an office, and the last note is quieter than the first
       because nothing in this building congratulates you.

     difference between the House, the press and a broadcast before they
     read the byline.

     "silent" is a register like any other and is spelt out in the table as
     nothing, rather than left out of it: the President's text makes no
     sound, and that is a decision somebody made, not an omission.

     THIS IS STILL SUBJECT TO THE HARD RULE AT THE TOP OF THE FILE. It is

     at a decision, choosing, rising - and never by a draw function. A

  /* ---------- room tone ----------
     Air handling, a long way off, through a bulkhead. Filtered noise for the
     plant and a low sine for the structure. It is meant to be noticed only
     when it stops, so it sits under everything.

     THE GAINS BELOW LOOK TOO HIGH AND ARE NOT. DO NOT "TIDY" THEM DOWN.

     A gain of 0.055 is a sensible peak for a CUE, which is a full-band
     oscillator: a 0.055 square through the 0.55 ui bus lands at -30 dBFS.
     The same number on the plant means something completely different,
     because the plant is white noise with a 220Hz lowpass in front of it
     and that filter throws away almost all of the signal:

       uniform noise            RMS 0.5774   (measured 0.5771 - the model holds)
       x lowpass 220 over 22k   x 0.1053     = 0.0608
       x 0.055 x room bus 0.3               = 0.00100  = -60 dBFS

     -60 dBFS is silence. The tone was running correctly and inaudibly for
     every player, thirty decibels under its own click, which is roughly a
     factor of eight in loudness. At 0.30 it lands at -45 dBFS: fifteen
     under the click, present in a quiet room, still gone the moment
     anything else happens.

     The 52Hz sine is a separate problem and only half fixable. Most laptop
     and monitor speakers reproduce nothing at 52Hz at all, so on that
     hardware the plant has to carry the whole effect; on headphones the
     sine is what makes it a large pressurised object rather than a hiss.
     0.05 is as far as it can go before it muddies the cues. */
