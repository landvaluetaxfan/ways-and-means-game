   FOCUS — what survives a re-render.

   THE PROBLEM THIS FILE EXISTS FOR:

     drawAll() replaces twenty-five containers with fresh innerHTML on
     every state change. Everything inside them is destroyed and rebuilt,
     which means the node that had focus is gone and focus falls to
     document.body. Measured, not assumed: focus a row in the orbit
     table, advance the sitting, and document.activeElement is the body.
     A keyboard player loses their place on every single decision.

   THE RULE: IDENTITY, NEVER A NODE AND NEVER AN INDEX.

     A node captured before the render does not exist after it, so
     holding one is holding a corpse. An index is worse than useless: the
     row at position four after the render may be a different bill, so
     restoring by index silently moves the player somewhere they did not
     ask to be, which is harder to notice than losing focus outright.
     What is recorded is the row's DATA KEY — the bill id, the station
     id, the document id — and the row is found again by asking the
     freshly rendered table which of its rows has that key.

     Position is recorded too, but ONLY as a fallback for the case below.

   WHEN THE THING IS GONE:

     nearest surviving sibling, then the panel itself, and never
     document.body without saying so. An instrument that was revoked
     between renders takes its row with it; the player's place should
     land beside where it was, not at the top of the document.

   ONE SELECTION STORE.

     Selection used to live in four places in three mechanisms — a
     dataset on #bill-detail, a dataset on #station-detail, a closure
     variable in Papers, and cxCurrent in ui.js. Nothing coordinated
     them, which is how the order paper came to hardcode its highlight
     to one bill and mark the wrong row for the whole of a game. SEL
     below is the only selection store. Renderers ask it what is
     selected; nothing else writes it.

   WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO: draw anything, know what a bill is, or
   make a sound. It moves focus and it remembers keys.
