/* =============================================================
   WAIT — the three ways this terminal says it is thinking.

   The machine in this game is a 2287 government terminal, and the one
   thing such a machine never does is finish instantly and say nothing.
   Three tiers, and which tier a thing gets is a judgement about how much
   it matters, not about how long it actually takes:

     1  BRIEF     a cursor, under about six hundred milliseconds. Purely
                  cosmetic. Granting a slot, making an order. The work is
                  already done when the cursor appears.

     2  DIALOG    a modal with a SEGMENTED bar. Discrete chunks, one per
                  sub-step, each labelled with what it is doing. Never a
                  smooth fill: a smooth bar is a lie about a process
                  nobody is measuring, and a chunked one is an honest
                  list of things that have to happen.

     3  STALL     the bar stops at a named point and says why. Fired from
                  a CONTENT FLAG and never from a random roll - a stall
                  the player cannot cause and cannot avoid is just an
                  annoyance, and one the fiction chose is a scene.

   THE ORDER OF EVENTS, WHICH IS THE WHOLE DESIGN:

     the state resolves FIRST, then the dialog narrates what already
     happened. Nothing here computes anything. That is what makes the
     skip safe - skipping cannot change an outcome that was decided
     before the first chunk lit - and it is why muting the audio and
     turning off streaming cannot move a number.
